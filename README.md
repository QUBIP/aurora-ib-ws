## About

**_A Rust workspace to build
an [OpenSSL Provider](ossl:man:provider)
based on [`aurora`][link:aurora]
for the Internet Browsing pilot of
[QUBIP](https://qubip.eu)._**

> [!WARNING]
> **This repository uses [submodules][git:submodules]!**
>
> Clone it using `git clone --recursive`, or remember to
> `git submodule update --init` after cloning.

The purpose of this repository is to aid in the development
of the [OpenSSL Provider](ossl:man:provider)
for the Internet Browsing pilot of
[QUBIP](https://qubip.eu).

It uses [`git-submodules`][git:submodules] to tie together specific revisions of [`aurora`][link:aurora] and [`openssl_provider_forge`][link:openssl_provider_forge].

[git:submodules]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
[link:aurora]: ./aurora
[link:openssl_provider_forge]: ./openssl-provider-forge-rs

### Submodules

- [`aurora`][link:aurora] is a Rust implementation of an OpenSSL provider, tailored for the PQC transition.
- [`openssl-provider-forge-rs`][link:openssl_provider_forge] contains Rust code that is needed _in order to_
  write an OpenSSL provider in Rust (like [`aurora`][link:aurora] but possibly also others).
  This includes FFI-compatible Rust representations of the relevant C constants,
  structs, etc. that are defined in various OpenSSL header files (e.g. the
  `OSSL_PARAM` struct and the C enum it uses internally in the `data_type`
  field), as well as some pure Rust macros that are useful when writing a
  provider (e.g. a macro for creating dispatch table entries from function
  pointers).

### Building and testing using `podman` (or Docker if you tweak the commands)

We have a Container image published
[on DockerHub][dockerImage-nix:dockerhub]
that has a minimal
system to build and test this project.

The `justfile` includes a convenience target to run either an
interactive shell session within the container, or specific commands.

```sh
just dockerImage-runner-interactive
```

or (for example)

```sh
just dockerImage-runner-interactive just gatherinfo
```

This assumes a working `podman` installation.
